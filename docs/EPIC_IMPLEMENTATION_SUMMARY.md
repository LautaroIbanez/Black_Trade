# Epic Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of all 5 epics for the Black Trade recommendation system.

## Epic 1: Claridad sobre la fuente de la señal ✅

**Objective**: Communicate which timeframes and strategies support each recommendation for multi-timeframe consensus understanding.

### Implemented Features:
- **Multi-timeframe Consensus Summary**: Added a new section in the Dashboard that groups strategies by timeframe
- **Strategy Participation Display**: Shows participating strategies with their signals (BUY/SELL/HOLD) and confidence scores
- **Tooltips and Explanations**: Added informative tooltips explaining the weighted consensus approach
- **Visual Design**: Clean, organized display that doesn't saturate the main view

### Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` - Added consensus summary component
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.css` - Added styling for consensus display

## Epic 2: Coherencia entre perfil temporal y recomendación ✅

**Objective**: Allow users to choose trading profiles (intraday vs swing) and recalibrate weights/filters accordingly.

### Implemented Features:
- **Trading Profile Selector**: Added UI selector with 4 profiles (Day Trading, Swing, Balanced, Long Term)
- **Profile-Specific Weights**: Implemented different timeframe weight configurations per profile
- **Backend Integration**: Modified `/recommendation` endpoint to accept profile parameter
- **Real-time Updates**: Recommendations update immediately when profile changes

### Profile Weight Configurations:
- **Day Trading**: 1h=1.0, 4h=0.8, 1d=0.4, 1w=0.2 (intraday focus)
- **Swing Trading**: 4h=1.0, 1d=0.9, 1h=0.6, 1w=0.3 (medium-term focus)
- **Balanced**: 1w=1.0, 1d=0.9, 4h=0.7, 1h=0.5 (equal consideration)
- **Long Term**: 1w=1.0, 1d=0.8, 4h=0.4, 1h=0.2 (long-term focus)

### Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` - Added profile selector
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.css` - Added profile selector styling
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Updated API call to include profile
- `backend/app.py` - Modified recommendation endpoint
- `backend/services/recommendation_service.py` - Added profile-specific weights

## Epic 3: Alineación entre ranking histórico y recomendación actual ✅

**Objective**: Avoid discrepancies when reusing historical scores by differentiating by timeframe.

### Implemented Features:
- **Timeframe-Specific Score Lookup**: Modified `_get_strategy_score` to use timeframe-specific historical scores
- **Improved Score Accuracy**: Each strategy now uses its score from the correct timeframe context
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing data structures

### Files Modified:
- `backend/services/recommendation_service.py` - Updated score lookup logic

## Epic 4: Transparencia de niveles operativos y trazabilidad ✅

**Objective**: Provide visibility into how entry range, SL, and TP are calculated and which strategies influenced them.

### Implemented Features:
- **Detailed Contribution Breakdown**: New data structure showing how each strategy contributed
- **Expandable Analysis Panel**: UI component showing detailed contribution analysis
- **Weighted Contribution Display**: Shows percentage contribution of each strategy
- **Entry/SL/TP Attribution**: Displays how each strategy influenced the final levels

### New Data Structures:
- `ContributionBreakdown` - Detailed contribution information per strategy
- `ContributionBreakdownResponse` - API response format

### Files Modified:
- `backend/services/recommendation_service.py` - Added contribution breakdown calculation
- `backend/app.py` - Added contribution breakdown to API response
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` - Added expandable breakdown panel
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.css` - Added breakdown panel styling

## Epic 5: Confianza diaria y monitorización continua ✅

**Objective**: Ensure daily signals are recalculated with updated data and detect misalignments.

### Implemented Features:
- **Scheduled Recalibration Job**: Automated job for periodic recommendation recalibration
- **Confidence Deviation Detection**: Alerts when confidence deviates significantly from historical scores
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Metrics logging and system health monitoring
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: UI component for viewing system health and alerts

### New Components:
- `backend/cron/recalibration_job.py` - Scheduled recalibration service
- `backend/api/routes/monitoring.py` - Monitoring API endpoints
- `frontend/src/components/MonitoringDashboard.jsx` - Monitoring UI
- `frontend/src/components/MonitoringDashboard.css` - Monitoring styling

### Monitoring Features:
- **System Health Scoring**: 0-100 health score based on multiple factors
- **Alert Classification**: High/Medium/Low severity alerts
- **Profile Performance Tracking**: Monitor how each trading profile performs
- **Strategy Usage Analytics**: Track which strategies are most commonly used
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatic detection of confidence anomalies

## Technical Improvements

### Backend Enhancements:
1. **Enhanced Recommendation Service**: Added profile support and contribution breakdown
2. **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Comprehensive logging and metrics collection
3. **API Extensions**: New endpoints for monitoring and health checks
4. **Data Structure Improvements**: Better organization of timeframe-specific data

### Frontend Enhancements:
1. **Improved User Experience**: Clear visual indicators and explanations
2. **Interactive Elements**: Expandable panels and real-time updates
3. **Comprehensive Information**: Detailed breakdowns without cluttering the interface
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts and components

### Data Flow Improvements:
1. **Timeframe-Specific Scoring**: More accurate historical performance integration
2. **Profile-Aware Recommendations**: Tailored recommendations based on trading style
3. **Transparent Calculations**: Full visibility into recommendation generation
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated quality assurance and alerting

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Recalibration Job:
```bash
# Run recalibration for all profiles
python backend/cron/recalibration_job.py

# Run for specific profiles
python backend/cron/recalibration_job.py --profiles "day_trading,swing"

# Run with custom symbol/timeframes
python backend/cron/recalibration_job.py --symbol BTCUSDT --timeframes "1h,4h,1d,1w"
```

### Monitoring Endpoints:
- `GET /api/monitoring/metrics` - Get latest monitoring metrics
- `GET /api/monitoring/alerts` - Get recent alerts
- `GET /api/monitoring/health` - Get system health status

### Frontend Components:
- **Dashboard**: Enhanced with consensus summary and contribution breakdown
- **MonitoringDashboard**: New component for system monitoring (can be added to main app)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Scheduling**: Integrate recalibration job with system scheduler (cron/systemd)
2. **Advanced Analytics**: More sophisticated anomaly detection algorithms
3. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and optimization for large-scale monitoring
4. **Integration**: Connect monitoring dashboard to external alerting systems (Slack, email)
5. **Machine Learning**: Implement ML-based confidence calibration

All epics have been successfully implemented with comprehensive testing and documentation.
